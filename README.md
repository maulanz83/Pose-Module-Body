# Pose Estimation Module With OpenCv and Mediapipe

This repository contains a Python module for real-time pose estimation using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV. The module detects human body landmarks in video frames and draws the detected landmarks on the frames.

Features
1. Pose Detection: Uses MediaPipe's pose detection capabilities to identify and track human body landmarks.
2. FPS Display: Calculates and displays the frames per second (FPS) on the video.
3. Configurable Parameters: Provides options to configure detection confidence, tracking confidence, and other parameters.

Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV
3. MediaPipe
